# Data type
csv

# How did you get your prototype working?
I made little modifications - I simply increased the sample rate so that I can have a finer precision to manipulate.

# Arduino Code
[Arduino Code](_1_A_inoModified/_1_A_inoModified.ino)

# Data Sample

# How did you collect this data?
I placed my arduino (with microphone sensor) in my living room while hanging out with friends. I plugged it into an AC power source and left it on for about 6 hours. 

# What signal do you think is in your data?
If I correctly understand what the data I have contains, I'd like to do simple Fourier Analysis to determine dominant pitches throughout the night.  If I simply have volume data I will examine loudness vs. time through the party.

# How fun was this mini-project? 
7

# How hard was it? 
8 - Only because I had never soldered nor worked with Arduino

# How much did you learn from the experience?
7 - Learned some great hardware fundamentals. Excited to learn more about the coding and analysis.
